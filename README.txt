XIV Weather

This is a small android application that I originally put together to help me find weather windows for fish in Final Fantasy XIV. I made it primarily as I don't play the game on PC and want to do this without using my phones data connection.

The application is written in c# and compiled using Xamrin in Visual Studio. 

Basic Usage:
Select a zone, desired weather, desired previous weather if a chain is needed, and the weather window(s) to look for the weather in. Click the "Find Weather" button and it will display the requested information. 

I work on this in my spare time and plan to add additional features but there's no real planned schedule or timeline.
