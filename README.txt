<h1>XIV Weather</h1>

This is a small android application that I originally put together to help me find weather windows for fish in Final Fantasy XIV. I made it primarily as I don't play the game on PC and want to do this without using my phones data connection.

The application is written in c# and compiled using Xamrin in Visual Studio. 

Basic Usage:
Weather Finder:
Select a zone, desired weather, desired previous weather if a chain is needed, and the weather window(s) to look for the weather in. If you leave any of these fields empty it just assumes you don't care what the values are for those items. Click the "Find Weather" button and it will display the requested information. 

I work on this in my spare time and plan to add additional features but there's no real planned schedule or timeline.
